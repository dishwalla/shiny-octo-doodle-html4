    <b><acronym title="One of my favourite books">No one writes to the colonel</acronym></b>
    <p>The book was written by <abbr title="Gabriel Garcia Marquez ">GGM</abbr> in 1961.</p>
    <p>The very topical quote is: <i><q>'l'm not sick,' the colonel said. 'The trouble is that in October I feel as if l had animals in my gut. </q></i></p>
